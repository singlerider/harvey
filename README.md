Hey there. I'm

## intro
I'm an automated service for user experience testing (UX) recruitment.

### What is UX?

It's a process for designing and iterating a product or service in ways that an end user wouldn't find confusing or frustrating.
For example, in a video game, if the player(s) feel like they are stuck in a specific area and are unsure how to progress, that could be considered a UX issue.

### Why does it matter? 

With today's highly competitive market of polished products, testing for things like this become increasingly important, which is a good thing, because it pushes the entire market to a higher standard of quality.
Getting valid participants can be quite a chore, especially for in-person testing.
Potential participants can be hard to find, which is why I'm here to help.

### Ok. So how can you help?

Well, there are teams of people that use information about their target demographic to get specific participants.
Although it is a good idea to get a variety of people to test, the core findings will matter most for a particular group of users.
Anyway, I allow researchers to go ahead and choose what kind of info they want people to select from on a survey.
They can target a huge pool of potential participants, gathering data on the responses of the answers from the surveys.
Using these data points, I figure out who is the most eligible to come in and test.
If a researcher wants someone that has never played an RPG game and plays 14 hours of FPS games a week, I will give them a list of people that fit that criteria.
One day, I'll be able make participants appointments and get confirmation from them from texts, calls, or emails.
