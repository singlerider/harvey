Hey there. I'm 

# harvey

I'm an automated service for user experience testing (UX) recruitment.

What is UX?

It's a process for designing and iterating a product or service in ways that an end user wouldn't find confusing or frustrating.
For example, in a video game, if the player(s) feel like they are stuck in a specific area and are unsure how to progress, that could be considered a UX issue.

Why does it matter? 

With today's highly competitive market of polished products, testing for things like this become increasingly important, which is a good thing, because it pushes the entire market to a higher standard of quality. Getting valid participants can be quite a chore, especially for in-person teating. Potential participants can be hard to find, which is why I'm here to help.
